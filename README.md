<h4> Issues Encountered & Learning Opportunities </h4>
<ol>
<li> Separating JQUERY and JavaScript</li>
<li> Identifying different syntax structure for JQUERY</li>
<li> Refraining from getting too granular.
 Ex: I spent time looking up how to consider the minutes of a clock when building and we only were to focus on the hours. </li>
